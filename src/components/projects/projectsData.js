    description:
      'A digital multimeter is a testing tool that measures ​voltage​, ​current​, and ​resistance values. It is an indispensable diagnostic tool for electrical technicians. When a problem occurs in the circuit, the first thing that the technicians would do is to use digital multimeters to check whether the components are properly supplied with a voltage.',

Digital devices only understand and compute in 1 and 0’s; therefore, the analog-to-digital converters are important components in order to convert the signals to 1 and 0’s.',
